Yo, dude! Long time no see. How’s life treating you? I saw your Instagram post and it looks like you’re killing it. Congrats on the new job! We should grab a beer sometime and celebrate. Speaking of which, have you tried that new brewery downtown? It’s sick. They have the best IPAs. Oh, and did you hear about that crazy party last weekend? Apparently, the cops showed up and shut it down. Too bad we missed out, haha. Anyway, hit me up if you wanna hang out.
