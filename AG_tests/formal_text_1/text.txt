Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to inquire about the status of my job application. I submitted my resume and cover letter a few weeks ago and have not yet received a response. I understand that you receive a high volume of applications, but I am very interested in this opportunity and would appreciate any information you can provide. I have a strong background in the field and believe I would be an asset to your team. I am eager to contribute my skills and experience to the organization and help achieve its goals. If there are any further steps I need to take to complete the application process, please let me know. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely,
