At the cellular level, biology explores the complex biochemical processes that enable cells to carry out their functions. This includes the synthesis of proteins, the regulation of gene expression, and the transport of molecules across cell membranes. Biologists also study how cells interact with each other to form tissues, organs, and organ systems in multicellular organisms. In addition to the study of individual organisms, biology also explores the interactions between different species and their environment. This includes the study of ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles, and the impact of human activities on the natural world. Biologists use a variety of tools and techniques to study these phenomena, including microscopy, genetics, and computer modeling.
