I'm a high school English teacher and today we started reading 'To Kill a Mockingbird' in class. It's one of my favorite novels and I love teaching it to my students. We discussed the historical context of the book and the themes of racism, prejudice, and social inequality. We also analyzed some of the key passages and talked about the author's use of language and symbolism. It was a great start to the unit and I'm looking forward to the discussions and assignments we'll have in the coming weeks.
