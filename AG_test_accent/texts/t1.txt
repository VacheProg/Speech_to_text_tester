I am a marine biologist and today was a very exciting day for me. I went on a research vessel to collect samples of plankton and other small organisms from the ocean. We used a specialized net to collect the samples, which we then analyzed under a microscope back at the lab. We found some really interesting specimens, including a new species of diatom that had never been identified before. It was a great day out on the water and I can't wait to see what other discoveries we make in the future.
