"The early memories of my childhood is… like…my parents uh…made me to have long hairs and I was like young Sardarji in my early days. At that particular point of time I mean, I never knew what is  all about, what religion, what caste, and what community all belongs to. Ok, they made me and I was like that. Then my parents, my father, grandfather never had long hair. Uh… But, my grandmother, she came from a Sar…Sardar family. So they thought ok, let him make a…let us make him a Sardarji. And uh initially my schooling was in a convent’s Christian school. Out there, uh, even in nursery classes… when I used to, when I used to go to nursery, I mean…being a Sardarji it was quite diff…diffi…different thing, because all the students out there were…nobody was Sardarji in them. I was the only student, and uh… the memories of that time are, like, constantly pulling my hair, students pulling my hairs and making fun of me. Even I used to get uh bogged by this particular thing that why I am like this…in my whole class, I mean, I am the target of satire: students teasing me, even girls teasing me. So I used to ask my mom, like, why I am like this, I mean, why I am Sardarji? And nobody is in the class. I mean, but, at that point of time there was no particular, definite answer.",24,Aman,boy
"Uh…I was born in Delhi in 1984 and then my father was transferred to Calcutta—in 1994; so I left Delhi was I was ten years old and then I spent uh most of my time in Calcutta—my schooling, and also my graduation. And for my post-graduation when I decided to come back to Delhi, I found out that Delhi has changed a lot. Anyway, I was a ten-year old kid, so I didn’t remember most of Delhi anyway. Uh…but I could make out that the city has progressed a lot and ...uh… but what really bugs me these days is that people whoever sees me here, the first question they tell me is which city do you like better? Calcutta or Delhi? And as I have come to realise over the last one and a half years, it’s very difficult to make a very clear-cut choice and distinction between the cities. uh… Delhi was the city I was born in uh and I am here right now. I’ve great friends, and a good University and everything is just good. But Calcutta was the place I grew up, and especially for a boy, who’s eleven-twelve years old, right up to his graduation: that is the point where he enjoys his studies, his friends a lot. And so when I first came to Delhi, I used to miss Calcutta a lot. Uh… but then I realised that what I was doing was I was shutting myself off from the environment of Delhi itself and then I decided to uh open up and visit other places and make new friends and tried to begin the old activities which I did in Calcutta uh… And now I’ve, I am seeing that Delhi is a very nice place itself. But still that doesn’t go very well to make a choice between Calcutta and Delhi and this is a question that uh these days I am turning around to other people who’ve come from Calcutta or from people from Delhi who are settled in Calcutta. And uh I really find that everybody is in the same situation. Nobody can make uh a clear choice about uh his or her city.",22,Arijit,boy
"'The other day we were just passing around and fou-found a wood of stick lying around at some point… just brought it up. We had a… gift of a ball from some guy in the morning. He just brought it in and then we started playing cricket in the corridor. And…even the teachers don’t object at this point of time…given up on us …either …come at nine in the morning, we hardly wake up at nine other days, but since it’s cricket we wake up at nine… stream in here, walk in straight to near the tea canteen there, and then start playing…",23,Rahul,boy
"Currently we are running a bad gang. And, I’m supposedly, I’m the mentor of the bad gang; and, we have so many friends over here. uh Besides that, uh my hobbies: playing tennis, uh, playing music and all, but uh, I like tennis because you have Roger Federer over there, Rafa Nadal, and I really love to see them fight over a court. uh and…that’s all about this sports…and music…uh…I love to sing songs, and, the whole strength in my body is my voice, uh and…I sing a lot and I hold a diploma in music, that’s in Karnatic vocal  music; so, I think I’m a good singer, and in a . . .good speaker also.",18,Vamsi,boy
